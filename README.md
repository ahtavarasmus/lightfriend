# Lightfriend
This repo is a being worked on and will become self-hostable in coolify. I'm integrating it with the main lightfriend cloud so that the only part of setting it up is buying a server from hostinger. I'm integrating this to interact with the lightfriend cloud server so that full zero trust privacy is maintained, but user doesn't need to setup any external services or worry about manual updates. Everything from domains, twilio phone numbers to private cloud api keys will be given to the user.

Lightfriend cloud is also fully open source at [github.com/ahtavarasmus/lightfriend-cloud](https://github.com/ahtavarasmus/lightfriend-cloud) and runs at lightfriend.ai at this moment
